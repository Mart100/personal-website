## Timeline

### How it started

Around 2019, when I was around 15 years old, I stumbled upon this game "Helmet Royale". Helmet Royale was a simple Battle-Royale style online game. Since the game was in its early stages and growing rapidly, I had made a simple website [HRInfo](https://mart100.github.io/HRinfo/) where players could find more indepth information about the game, such as weapons, maps, etc.

Since the game was gaining popularity, people started playing it competitively, so I implemented a ranking system and "clans" system on the website, toghether with a discord bot for the game. Competitive tournaments started being helt for the game, however this was all done manually with big excel sheets. This is where I started working on a bot that could automate the process of creating and managing tournaments. At first, the bot was only used for Helmet Royale, but I quickly realized that this could be used for any game.

This is where Toorney was born. Togheter with a friend who was well versed in various competitive communities, we started working on Toorney, and finding tournament organizers who were interested in using the bot. The first few tournaments went quite bad, since the bot was still full of bugs, but after most bugs were squashed the bot was finnaly usable. I started adding more and more features to the bot, such as a web dashboard, the ability for teams, and a page on the website where players can find all the tournaments that are being held.

### How it ended

Eventually I was busy with other things, and didn't have time to expand Toorney further. This is when Tournament Kings came into the picture. Tournament Kings was a company that was doing the same thing as Toorney, but with a bigger team and more resources. They offered me a deal to buy Toorney, and I accepted.

In the end Toorney.xyz was used for 463 different tournaments, with its biggest finished tournament having 62 players.
